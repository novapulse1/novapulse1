# Nova Pulse — web

The Nova Pulse application: marketing site, blog, admin lead dashboard and API, in one
Next.js 16 app. It began as a port of the legacy single-file `index.html` and has since
grown a database, an admin area and pages of its own.

Repository overview and deployment summary: [`../README.md`](../README.md).

- **34 pages**, everything prerendered except `/admin` and `/api`.
- **Builds with no environment variables** — the database is only needed for the demo
  form and the admin area.
- Vitest integration tests, browser end-to-end tests, typecheck and lint are enforced in CI.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local        # then fill in Neon URLs and AUTH_SECRET
npm run db:migrate                # apply the schema
npm run db:seed-admin             # create your first admin login
npm run db:seed-content           # import the MDX posts into the database
npm run dev                       # http://localhost:3000
```

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` / `build` / `start` | the app |
| `npm test` | Vitest suite (needs an isolated local database named `*_test`) |
| `npm run test:e2e` | production build plus Playwright browser tests (same isolated database rule) |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm run db:generate` | write a new migration from schema changes |
| `npm run db:migrate` | apply pending migrations |
| `npm run db:studio` | browse the data |
| `npm run db:seed-admin` | create or update an admin user |
| `npm run db:seed-content` | one-time import of `content/blog/*.mdx` into `posts` (idempotent) |

## Illustrations

`components/illustrations/` holds original SVG scenes drawn in the brand palette —
attendance flow, payroll flow, security, hiring, growth. They are **not stock photos
and not scraped images**: those would be someone else's copyright on a commercial
site. These are owned outright, weigh a few KB each, stay sharp at any size, and
animate.

Motion inside them uses CSS (`offset-path`, keyframes), never SMIL — SMIL cannot be
switched off by `prefers-reduced-motion`, so a `<animateMotion>` would keep moving for
someone who asked it not to. Every keyframe lives in `globals.css` under a
`prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference` guard, so the scenes degrade to static artwork.

Content files pick a scene by name through the registry in
`components/illustrations/index.tsx`, the same pattern as the icon registry.
**Ten scenes, each used exactly once** — five for services, five for industries.
If you add a page, draw it a new scene rather than reusing one; a repeated
illustration reads as filler.

Each scene namespaces its gradient ids (`fac-violet`, `cli-violet`, …). SVG ids are
document-global, so without that two scenes on one page would both define
`np-violet` and the second would silently inherit the first's colours.

## Interactive pieces

- `components/tools/payroll-savings.tsx` — the estimator on `/services/hrms-payroll`.
  It models **effort in hours, not money saved**, and prints its assumptions on screen,
  because a rupee "ROI" figure would be a number we cannot stand behind.
- `components/ui/accordion.tsx` — button + `aria-expanded` rather than `<details>`, so
  only one panel opens and the state is announced.
- `components/ui/reading-progress.tsx`, `back-to-top.tsx` — long-page navigation.
- Blog tags are real filters (`/blog?tag=…`), server-rendered, with an empty state.
- `.np-range` in `globals.css` gives the sliders a 28px hit area while keeping the
  visible track thin; a bare `input[type=range]` is ~8px and fails touch guidelines.

## Content and motion

**Pages** are content-driven wherever there is a set of them. `content/services.ts`
(5 services), `content/industries.ts` (5 sectors), `content/company.ts` (values,
credentials, locations, leadership, roles) and `content/clients.ts` each drive their
pages plus the nav, footer, sitemap and JSON-LD. Adding a sixth service or sector is
adding an object, not building a page.

Two arrays in `content/company.ts` are **deliberately empty**: `leadership` and
`openRoles`. The original site never named anyone and had no advertised vacancies, so
populating them would mean inventing facts about real people and real jobs. Both
sections hide themselves until you fill them in.

**CMS scope is limited to Blog and Services.** Posts and service pages are managed at
`/admin/blog` and `/admin/services`; public navigation, footer links, sitemap and JSON-LD
read those published records. The other marketing pages remain code-managed, so the admin
cannot accidentally alter legal, company, client or industry content.

**Blog posts** live in Postgres and are written at `/admin/blog` — no commit, no
redeploy. `lib/blog/` is the only thing the public pages talk to: `repository`
holds the SQL, `service` holds the rules, `actions` holds the form handlers, and
`index.ts` is the read API the pages use. Reading time and the on-this-page nav
are **derived at read time**, never stored, so editing a body cannot leave them
stale. `/blog/feed.xml` and the sitemap come from the same source, and drafts
appear in none of them.

The MDX files in `content/blog/` are the **seed source**, imported once by
`npm run db:seed-content`. They are kept as a rollback path, not read at runtime.

**Post bodies are Markdown, not MDX, and that is a security decision.**
`MDXRemote` compiles and *evaluates* its source. That is fine for files in git,
where a human reviews every commit; it is not fine for a database column, because
then a phished marketing account is server-side code execution. Bodies render
through `react-markdown` (`lib/blog/markdown.tsx`), which evaluates nothing. The
one `<Callout>` from the MDX era survives as a `:::callout` directive, styled by
the same component, so migrated posts look identical.

**Motion** is hand-rolled rather than a library, for three reasons that matter
on a site whose traffic is SEO-driven:

1. `<Reveal>` is a **server** component. It emits data attributes only; one
   shared IntersectionObserver in the layout drives every reveal on the page. So
   scroll animation costs no per-element client JavaScript and sections stay
   server-rendered.
2. The hidden state is CSS scoped to `.js`, set by an inline script before first
   paint. **Without JavaScript nothing is ever hidden**, so crawlers and no-JS
   visitors always see complete content. An inline 3-second failsafe reveals
   everything if hydration never happens.
3. **Above-the-fold hero text is deliberately not animated.** Fading in the LCP
   element delays LCP by the length of the animation. Motion starts below the
   fold.

Horizontal (`left`/`right`) reveal variants are scoped to ≥768px, because a
translateX can push content past the edge of a phone screen mid-animation.

## How it is layered

Requests flow one direction, and each layer only knows the one below it:

```
route handler / server action   transport — parse, map errors to HTTP, no rules
        ↓
lib/leads/service.ts            the rules: validate, rate limit, persist, notify
        ↓
lib/leads/repository.ts         the only module that writes SQL for leads
        ↓
lib/db/                         schema + connection
```

Two things fall out of this. `lib/leads/validation.ts` is imported by *both* the
browser form and the API route, so the two can never disagree about what a valid
lead is. And the service returns a `Result` (`lib/result.ts`) rather than throwing
for expected outcomes — a caller cannot forget to handle "rate limited", because
the type will not let it.

`server-only` is imported at the top of every module that touches secrets or the
database; if one is ever pulled into a client component the build fails rather
than shipping credentials to the browser.

## Layout

```
app/
  layout.tsx            <html>/<body>, metadata, Organization JSON-LD, modal provider
  (site)/
    layout.tsx          header + footer chrome for the main marketing site
    page.tsx            homepage — composes the 14 sections, FAQPage JSON-LD
    services/           index + [slug], driven by content/services.ts
    industries/         index + [slug], the sector view of the same stack
    blog/               index, [slug], feed.xml
    about/ contact/     company story; contact with the inline lead form
    clients/ careers/   proof page; careers with general application
    privacy-policy/     new — the footer had linked to a non-existent page
    terms-conditions/   new — same
  products/page.tsx     port of products.html; has its own dark nav/footer,
                        which is why the chrome lives in (site) and not the root
  sitemap.ts robots.ts  generated at build time
  icon.png              favicon (was Fevicon.png.png, 1.09MB → 80KB)
components/
  sections/             one file per homepage section, all server components
  site-header.tsx       client — mobile drawer state
  demo-modal.tsx        client — modal context + <DemoButton>
  api/leads/route.ts    public lead capture
  admin/
    login/              unguarded, deliberately outside the protected group
    (protected)/        layout guards everything beneath it

      leads/[id]/       detail: status, notes, attribution
      export/route.ts   CSV
components/
  page-hero.tsx         shared hero for secondary pages
  cta-band.tsx          shared closing CTA

## Notes for whoever picks this up

- **Only two components ship JavaScript** — the header and the modal. Every section is a
  server component, so its markup and icons cost nothing on the client. Keep it that way:
  reach for `<DemoButton>` rather than making a whole section a client component.
- **Icons are `react-icons/fa6`, not lucide.** The legacy site used Font Awesome 6, so these
  are the identical glyphs — but rendered as inline SVG, with no 258KB webfont. The
  `svg[stroke="currentColor"][fill="currentColor"]` rule in `globals.css` gives them Font
  Awesome's inline metrics so spacing matches; don't delete it.
- **`--font-sans` and the h1 line-height are pinned on purpose.** Tailwind 4.3 changed its
  default font stack, and v4 resolves `text-6xl` + `leading-tight` differently from v3.
  Both are pinned in place to match the legacy rendering exactly.
- **The brand palette in `app/globals.css` is deliberately non-standard** (900/950 are darker
  than Tailwind's stock purple). It was copied verbatim from the legacy inline
  `tailwind.config`. Don't "fix" it.
- **Legal pages are unreviewed drafts.** They describe what the site actually does, but they
  need a lawyer before you rely on them.
- **`/products` intentionally differs from the live `products.html`.** The legacy page's
  own CSS asks for a 1200px container, but `margin: 0 auto` on a flex-column child disables
  `align-items: stretch`, so it shrink-wraps to 916px and the cards fall into 2 columns with
  an orphan. This port uses the container width and grid rule as written, giving 3 columns.
  Revert `app/products/page.tsx` to a fixed `max-w-[916px]` if you want the live behaviour.
- The legacy `index.html` and `products.html` are still in the repo root, untouched and
  still live. Nothing here affects them.

## Data and privacy

- **IP addresses are never stored in the clear.** `hashIdentifier()` HMACs them
  with `AUTH_SECRET` before they touch the database. That still supports rate
  limiting and abuse triage, and it is the minimum we can justify holding as a
  Data Fiduciary under the DPDP Act.
- **Deleting a lead cascades to its notes**; removing a user leaves their notes
  in place with the author name intact, so history survives staff changes.
- The daily maintenance job removes enquiries after 24 months unless they became a customer.

## Production notes

- **Cover image uploads need `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`** (Vercel dashboard →
  Storage → Blob → Connect). Two config entries in `next.config.ts` go with it:
  `https://*.public.blob.vercel-storage.com` in the CSP `img-src`, and the same
  host in `images.remotePatterns`. Miss either and covers break in production
  while working locally. Without the token the admin still works; uploads return
  a 503 saying exactly what is missing.
- **`POST /api/admin/upload` sniffs magic bytes**, not `Content-Type` and not the
  extension — a `.php` renamed to `.png` is rejected on its first three bytes. The
  stored filename is generated, never the client's, since an uploaded name can
  carry path separators. The endpoint accepts up to 4 MB (within Vercel's request
  limit), normalizes still images to WebP, and limits each admin to 40 uploads per hour.

- **Security headers** live in `next.config.ts`: CSP, HSTS, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`,
  `nosniff`, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy. The CSP is a static header rather than a
  per-request nonce, because a nonce would force every route to render dynamically. If you
  add a third-party script or embed, it must be added to the CSP or it will be blocked.
- **Previews are noindex.** `robots.ts` and the root metadata gate on `isProduction`
  (`lib/site.ts`), so preview deploys never get indexed or emit production canonicals.
- **`app/opengraph-image.tsx`** generates the 1200x630 social card at build time. The raw
  logo is transparent and vanished on dark backgrounds; this composites it on brand colour.
- **Accessibility:** skip link, a global `:focus-visible` ring (several legacy elements had
  `focus:outline-none` with no replacement), a focus trap and focus restore on the demo
  modal, and `prefers-reduced-motion` honoured globally.
- **The CSP allows `unsafe-eval` and a websocket in development only.** React's dev
  build needs eval and the dev server needs HMR; `upgrade-insecure-requests` is also
  dropped in dev because it rewrites the local websocket to wss. Production keeps all
  three restrictions. If you add a third-party embed, it must go in the CSP.
- **`<html>` carries `suppressHydrationWarning`** because the inline script adds a
  `js` class before React hydrates. It is scoped to that element's attributes only.
- **Tap targets** were padded to a 24px minimum. This is the one deliberate visual change
  from the legacy site: it makes the footer link lists slightly taller and is why the page
  measures 11,426px against the legacy 11,368px.
- **Every lead form shares `lib/use-lead-submit.ts`** — the modal, the contact page
  and the careers page. Validation handling, attribution capture and error copy cannot
  drift apart between them.
- **The demo form posts to `/api/leads`.** Formspree is gone, and the CSP no longer
  allows it. Defences on that endpoint: a honeypot, five submissions per IP per hour,
  and validation shared with the client.
- **The honeypot answers 201.** A 422 naming the `_gotcha` field would tell a bot
  exactly what unmasked it, so a trapped submission looks like success and is
  silently dropped. There is a test asserting the error kind is `rejected` and not
  `validation`, because that distinction is easy to break by accident.
- **A failed notification email never fails a lead.** The lead and a durable notification
  job are committed together; sends retry with backoff through the lead request and daily
  maintenance job.
- **Sessions** are HS256 JWTs in an httpOnly, SameSite=Lax cookie, 8 hour expiry.
  Every request re-reads the user, so a deleted account loses access immediately
  rather than whenever its token happens to expire.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs typecheck, lint and build on every push and PR.

## Deploying to Vercel

The app builds with **no environment variables at all** — every page prerenders, so the
marketing site works immediately. Blog reads degrade to an empty list rather than failing
the build (`safely()` in `lib/blog/index.ts`), so a database blip during a deploy costs you
the blog index, not the other thirty pages. The database is needed for the demo form,
`/admin` and the blog; without it those fail and nothing else does.

1. **Push this repo to GitHub.** Everything except `node_modules/`, `.next/` and the
   `.env*` files (roughly 2.4 MB).

2. **Import it on Vercel** — vercel.com/new → pick the repo → set
   **Root Directory: `web`**. Framework and build command are detected. Deploy.
   You now have a working preview URL, which is served `noindex` (see `robots.ts`).

3. **Create a Neon Postgres database.** Copy both connection strings from Neon: the
   **pooled** URL for the application and the **direct** URL for schema changes.

4. **Add environment variables** in Project → Settings → Environment Variables:

   | Name | Value | Required |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | `DATABASE_URL` | Neon pooled connection string | for leads + admin |
   | `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` | Neon direct connection string | for migrations and seeds |
   | `AUTH_SECRET` | `openssl rand -base64 32` | for leads + admin |
   | `CRON_SECRET` | separate `openssl rand -base64 32` value | for daily maintenance |
   | `RESEND_API_KEY` | from resend.com | optional |
   | `LEAD_NOTIFICATION_TO` | `growth@novapulse.co.in` | optional |
   | `LEAD_NOTIFICATION_FROM` | `Nova Pulse <notifications@yourdomain>` | optional |
   | `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` | added automatically by Storage → Blob → Connect | for blog cover uploads |

   `AUTH_SECRET` signs admin sessions **and** the HMAC that hashes visitor IPs — changing
   it later logs everyone out and orphans existing rate-limit buckets.

5. **Run the migration once**, from your machine against the remote database:

   ```bash
   cd web
   DIRECT_DATABASE_URL="<neon-direct-url>" npm run db:migrate
   ```

   Migrations are deliberately *not* wired into the build: preview deploys share the same
   database, and you do not want a preview build migrating production.

6. **Create your admin login, and import the existing posts:**

   ```bash
   DIRECT_DATABASE_URL="<neon-direct-url>" npm run db:seed-admin
   DIRECT_DATABASE_URL="<neon-direct-url>" npm run db:seed-content
   ```

   `db:seed-content` is idempotent — it skips any slug that already exists, so re-running
   it can never overwrite a post someone has edited in `/admin`.

7. **Add a Blob store** if you want cover image uploads: Storage → Blob → Connect. This
   sets `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` for you. Skip it and everything else still works.

8. **Redeploy** so the new variables are picked up, then check `/`, submit the demo form,
   sign in at `/admin`, and create a draft and published record in each of Blog and Services.
   `vercel.json` runs `/api/cron/maintenance` daily to retry notifications, purge expired
   enquiries, prune rate-limit records and remove unreferenced uploads after a grace period.

9. **Point the domain.** Project → Settings → Domains → add `novapulse.co.in` and
   `www.novapulse.co.in`, then update DNS at your registrar. Only do this once the preview
   looks right — until then the old site stays live and untouched.

`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is only needed if you deploy somewhere other than Vercel; on Vercel
the canonical URL is inferred, and previews resolve to their own host (see `lib/site.ts`).
